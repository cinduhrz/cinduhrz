My name is Cindy Wong and I'm currently a software engineering fellow at General Assembly, projected to graduate in April 2023 (very soon!). I started my coding journey in my junior year of college with some intro classes and was hooked. I am fascinated by how code, a finite number of characters and numbers, allows for so much possibility.
